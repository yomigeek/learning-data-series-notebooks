    "Complete case analysis is basically analyzing those observations in the dataset that contains values in all the variables.

    "So, it can be used when missing data is small but in real-life datasets, the amount of missing data is always big. So, practically, complete case analysis is never an option to use, although you can use it if the missing data size is small."

    "The provided code and explanation describe a technique called \"Missing Value Indicator for Missing Value Indication.\" This technique involves creating a binary indicator variable to explicitly capture whether a particular observation has a missing value. Additionally, it includes imputing the missing values in the original variable using mean or median imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Missing Indicator Variable:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   X_train['Age_NA'] = np.where(X_train['Age'].isnull(), 1, 0)\n",
    "   X_test['Age_NA'] = np.where(X_test['Age'].isnull(), 1, 0)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This code creates a new binary variable, 'Age_NA,' which takes the value 1 if the corresponding 'Age' value is missing and 0 otherwise. This variable serves as an indicator of missingness.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Impute Missing Values with Median:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   X_train['Age'].fillna(X_train.Age.median(), inplace=True)\n",
    "   X_test['Age'].fillna(X_train.Age.median(), inplace=True)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - The missing values in the 'Age' variable are imputed using the median of the non-missing values in the training set. Both the training and test sets are imputed with the median from the training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reasoning:**\n",
    "   - The combination of creating a missing indicator and imputing with the median allows for capturing the information about missing values. If the fact that a value is missing has predictive power, it can be captured by the 'Age_NA' variable. Meanwhile, if the missing value itself is not informative, it gets replaced by the median value.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Check the Result:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   X_train.head(10)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This line prints the first 10 rows of the modified training set to show the impact of the missing value indicator and imputation.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Replace with Median when Mean and Median are the Same:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   X_train['Age'].fillna(X_train.Age.median(), inplace=True)\n",
    "   X_test['Age'].fillna(X_train.Age.median(), inplace=True)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - In this specific case where the mean and median of the 'Age' variable are the same, the missing values are replaced with the median.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key idea is to retain information about missing values using the binary indicator while imputing missing values with a central tendency measure (median in this case). This approach is particularly useful when missingness itself might be predictive or informative in the dataset."
